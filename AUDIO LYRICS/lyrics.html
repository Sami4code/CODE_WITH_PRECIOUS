    <h1>Lucky Dube - It's Not Easy</h1>

    <pre>Uuuhhh! yeaahh haahh ahh
        Lord of mercy!
        I remember the day I called mama on the telephone
        I told her mama I'm getting married, I could hear her voice
        On the other side of the telephone, she was smiling
        And she asked me a question that I proudly answered
        She said, "Son did you take time to know her?"
        I said mama she's the best but today it hurts me so
        To go back to mama and say mama I'm getting divorced
        Oh I'm getting divorced
        This choice I made didn't work out
        The way I thought it would
        This choice I made. It hurts me so mama,
        This choice i made, didnt work out the way i thought it would, this choice of mine oh!
        Mama said me.</pre>
