    <h1>Lucky Dube - It's Not Easy</h1>

    <pre>Uuuhhh! yeaahh haahh ahh
        Lord of mercy!
        I remember the day I called mama on the telephone
        I told her mama I'm getting married, I could hear her voice
        On the other side of the telephone, she was smiling
        And she asked me a question that I proudly answered
        She said, "Son did you take time to know her?"
        I said mama she's the best but today it hurts me so
        To go back to mama and say mama I'm getting divorced
        Oh I'm getting divorced
        This choice I made didn't work out
        The way I thought it would
        This choice I made. It hurts me so mama,
        This choice i made, didnt work out the way i thought it would, this choice of mine oh!
        Mama said me.
        It's not easy to understand it son
        But I hope you'll make it, you'll be happy again. 2x
        I remember in church, when the preacher man read the scriptures
        You looked so beautiful, so beautiful and so innocent
        I did not know that behind that beauty
        Lies the true colors that will destroy me in the near future
        This choice I made didn't work out to be what i thought it be
        Oh!, mama
        This choice i made didnt work out the way i thought it would now am hurting.
        I remember when I held you
        By the hand preacher man read the scriptures
        Putting words in your mouth.
        Maybe what the preacher man said
        Was not something that was within you.
        Now I know what they mean when they say
        "Beautiful woman is another man's play thing"
        Oh! Lord! I'm hurting now
        This choice I made didn't work out
        The way I thought it would, this choice of mine oh!
        Mama said to me
        It's not easy to understand it son
        But I hope you'll make it, you'll be happy again.</pre>
